## Act phase

I am applying my insights to Bellabeat's product, Ivy, a wellness tracker for women with the following features:
* Cycle tracking
* Activity tracking
* Heart rate tracking
* Respiratory rate tracking
* Stress level tracking
* Mindfulness tracking
* Hydratiob tracking
* Sleep duration tracking
* Sleep quality tracking
* Readiness score based on the body's bio response
* Wellness score based on efforts throughout the day

#### Recommendations:

1. Users have a problem with tracking weight. To tackle this problem, send users regular reminders on the Bellabeat app to log their weight if they start tracking it.
2. Congratulate users in the morning if they sleep for the recommended 7 hours. Ivy's sleep duration and sleep quality tracking feature can help in this.
3. Ivy's sleep tracker can be used to check if users are falling asleep within 20 minutes of being in bed. If a user has a regular problem with this then they can be prompted to tackle it.
4. Not a single user was active everyday for the recommended time duration. Ivy's activity tracker can be used to check daily activity and prompt users to be active. Additionally, this feeds into the daily Wellness score for the user, which motivates the user to be active.
5. If a user is under 5000 steps by sunset then the app can prompt them to get to 5000 steps. Moreover, if users can set their own daily step goal it will motivate them to get in their steps for the day. Again, steps feed into the daily Wellness score for the user, which motivates the user further.


#### In conclusion:

Bellabeat should focus on how the Ivy can do all of the fitness tracking that a FitBit can do, with the added features of tracking an array of wellness indicators that can help women not only in physical fitness, but in all aspects of life.
